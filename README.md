# MetaSUB 2017 Global City Sampling Day Visualization
The Metagenomics and Metadesign of the Subways and Urban Biomes (MetaSUB) International consortium recently held their second annual Global City Sample Day (GCSD2017), where researchers and scientists collected samples from subway systems around the world. Ultimately, these samples will help build a world-wide DNA map of the microbiomes of mass transit systems. Landscape Metrics built a live sample map for GCSD2017, dynamically aggregating and visualizing thousands of sample points in locations across all seven continents. This map allows users to explore the data over time and space, smoothly transitioning between different scales, animating the map over time, and filtering the map by a host of data attributes.
